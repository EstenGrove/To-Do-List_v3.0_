Notes: 

To Do List:

App Logic(notes):

- create a function that when triggered does the following:
    -grabs the textContent or innerHTML of the input
    -creates a new element that's a child of the list-container 'div'
    -adds the textContent/innerHTML from the input's value and adds that to the list item that's created. 
    - assign this function to the 'Add' button(btn)
    
- create a function that when triggered deletes/removes the list item completely
    - assign this function to trigger when clicking an 'X' located on each list item
    
    
- For creating tags
    - create color coded tags that the user can add to different catergorized list items
        - Example: yellow(school), green(excercise), red(work) etc
        
Sidebar:

- consider adding a sidebar where the user can see different categories at a glance.
